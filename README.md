We found a Meta Quest bug where scrolling with the controller's joystick just stops scrolling vertically or horizontally only when the pointer is on Compose item in the collection.
 
If you hover in-between the gaps or just below or above the actual item then scrolling works again. Also if you turn off Compose in Collections scrolling works without any issues.
